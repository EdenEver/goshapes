# GDBlocks
## Spline-modelling Addon for Godot

GDBlocks is a work in progress - use in projects at your own risk.

GDBlocks is a work in progress project aimed to make level building in Godot a
bit easier. 

GDBlocks wraps wall geometry around splines in Godot using CSG.

It's implemented as an addon in GDScript. It works reasonably well but could
use some optimisation.

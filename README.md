# Goshapes for Godot 4
## Intuitive path-based level creation for Godot 4

Goshapes makes it easy to rapidly generate levels in Godot 4. I'm still in the midst of compiling documentation but there is now a handy demo scene.

### Installation
To install, clone this repository into the addons folder of your Godot 4 project, so that its path in your project is `res://addons/goshapes`.

### Samples
A sample scene, and some smaple shape styles and materials have been included under the `samples` subdirectory. Have a play around there, it should become obvious what the tools can do.

### What about GDBlocks for Godot 3?
I initially developed this addon for Godot 3, as [GDBlocks](https://github.com/daleblackwood/gdblocks). This version marks an increase in scope that was made possible thanks to new tools and performance improvements in Godot 4. As the change is quite dramatic, I've decided to fork my own project and make the improvements here. Going forward, this will be the only active project in development.
